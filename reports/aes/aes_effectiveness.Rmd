# Introduction

## The burden of malaria

- 2015: 212M cases; 429K deaths (global). 
- Mozambique among ten highest burden countries in world. 
- 29% reduction since 2010.  
- Now, focus on _elimination_ and _eradication_.

## How to eliminate

- Mass drug administration (MDA).  
- Other, more time-tested strategies (ITNs, IRS).
- The need for operational research. 

## It's hard to evaluate elimination strategies

- Difficult to measure impact of interventions in operational research.  
- OR is usually not experimental, not randomized, not controlled.
- Before vs. after and case vs. control approaches are useful, but biased.

## Why evaluate?

- The WHO explicitly supports “the need for more research on the optimum methods of implementing MDA programs, promoting community participation and compliance with treatment, and evaluating their effectiveness.

- As elimination initiatives imply both strong financial/economic efforts and a high risk of failure, their affordability, sustainability and cost-effectiveness are among the main concerns of funders, stakeholders and policymakers 

- Evidence of the causal impact of malaria elimination initiatives is a pre-requisite for evaluating their cost-effectiveness. Finally, rigorous impact evaluations of malaria elimination programs are essential for sustained financial and political support. 

## How to evaluate?

- Since we don't have an experiment, we need quasi-experimental approaches.  
- The synthetic control method (SCM).  
- We want to construct a _realistic_ counterfactual telling us _what would have happened_ without the campaign.  

## What are we evaluating, exactly?

- Malaria elimination campaign in Magude.  
- Deployed during rainy seasons of 2015-6 and 2016-7. 
- Consisted of MDA, IRS, and surveillance. 
- ITN coverage was already high from 2014.  


# Methods

## Data 

- Mozambique’s Boletim Epidemiológico Semanal (BES) of the NMCP.  
- Weekly clinical cases, by age group, by health facility, for each of a few high risk diseases
, the epidemic disease reporting system used by the NMCP. 
- Population estimates from the National Statistical Institute (INE).  

## Identification strategy

- Treatment group is district of Magude, Maputo province. 
- Control group consists of the other districts in Maputo and Gaza province. 
- The selection of control districts from locations around Magude is to ensure treatment and control groups have similar epidemiological characteristics. 

## Co-variates

Our analysis uses variables as predictors of malaria incidence:  

- LLINs   

- Average weekly temperature  

- Weekly rainfall

## Rainfall

## Difference in differences

- We _could_ compare changes in malaria incidence to other districts using a difference-in-differences (DD) model. 
- Often used to estimate treatment effects in such settings by contrasting changes in outcome pre- and -post intervention, for the treatment and control groups.
- Eliminates confounding due to time-invariant differences between treatment and control groups, arising from unobservable factors that might influence malaria incidence. 
- Assumes that any macro shocks such as time effects are common to the groups under evaluation. 

## Why we can't use difference in differences

```{r}
x <- df %>%
  filter(disease == 'MALARIA') %>%
  mutate(place = ifelse(district == 'MAGUDE', 'Magude',  'Other districts')) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste0(year, '-', month, '-01'))) %>%
  group_by(date, place) %>%
  summarise(p = sum(cases) / sum(population) * 1000)

g1 <- ggplot(data = x,
       aes(x = date,
           y = p,
           group = place)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = place), alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date(paste0(2010:2017, '-01-01'))),
             color = 'black',
             alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(x = 'Date',
       y = 'Monthly cases per 1,000') +
  scale_color_manual(name = 'District',
                     values = c('red', 'black')) +
  labs(title = 'Incidence: Magude vs. other districts',
       subtitle = 'All age groups') +
  theme_maltem() +
  xlim(as.Date('2013-01-01'), max(x$date))


x2 <- df %>%
  filter(disease == 'MALARIA') %>%
  mutate(place = ifelse(district == 'MAGUDE', 'Magude',  'Other districts')) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste0(year, '-', month, '-01'))) %>%
  group_by(date, place) %>%
  summarise(p = sum(cases) / sum(population) * 1000) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(magude_to_other = p[place == 'Magude'] / 
              p[place == 'Other districts'] * 100)

g2 <- ggplot(data = x2,
       aes(x = date,
           y = magude_to_other)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date(paste0(2010:2017, '-01-01'))),
             color = 'black',
             alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100,
             col = 'darkred',
             alpha = 0.6,
             lty = 2) +
  labs(x = 'Date',
       y = 'Percent') +
  labs(title = 'Magude incidence as % of other districts',
       subtitle = 'All age groups') +
  theme_maltem() +
  xlim(as.Date('2013-01-01'), max(x$date))
Rmisc::multiplot(g1, g2, cols = 2)
```

## Why not DiD?  

- Magude shows a downward trend in incidence over time, even prior to the elimination campaign.
- Lack of a visible parallel trend between treatment and control groups 

## SCM

- We employ the synthetic control method (SCM).  
- Weighted combination of potential control districts, the synthetic control, using the districts that best approximate the most relevant characteristics of malaria incidence in Magude before the intervention. 
- Characteristics include pre-intervention malaria incidence during rainy season, temperature and and rainfall.
- Good match based on RMSE.  

## Advantages of SCM

- Makes explicit the relative contribution of selected control districts to the counterfactual; the similarities between Magude and the synthetic control can be evaluated by comparing pre-intervention outcomes and predictors.  
- Allows the effects of unobserved factors on malaria incidence to vary with time, relaxing the parallel trend assumption of DD discussed earlier. 

## Limitations of SCM

- Does not allow assessing the significance of the results using commonly used (large-sample) inferential techniques. 
- Instead, we use placebo experiments based on permutation techniques to make inference:  sequentially applying the SCM assuming each control district was “treated” to generate a distribution of placebo effects, and compare Magude's effect with these distributions.

## Effect of interevention

Relative to the synthetic control, the average treatment effect during the first post-intervention malaria season was a reduction in weekly incidence by 4 and 2 cases per 1,000 in those aged 0-4 and 5 or older, respectively. During peak malaria season (January - March), 1,939 cases were prevented in 2016, and 3,405 in 2017.

This represents a 91.29% and 81.3% reduction in the incidence of malaria relative to the hypothetical control.

# Discussion

## Our findings

-  Across age groups during the peak malaria season (January-March) incidence declined by 91.29% and 81.3% in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  
- Has not achieved zero cases.  
- Unsure, at this point, to what extent we can attribute cases to importation or other causes. 

## Comparison with other findings

- Similar findings obtained in a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) estimating the effectiveness of MDA with DHA/PPQ in Zambia.

- In that study, while the number of malaria cases significantly declined after MDA in low-transmission areas, drop was not significant in areas of high transmission (ie, Magude).

- Also consistent with the predictions of a consensus study that put together 4 models focusing on the impact of MDA with a drug having similar characteristics as DHA/PPQ.  

- The latter predicted an immediate (but transient w/o other interventions) decline in malaria prevalence after MDA.  

## Quasi-experimental methods in similar contexts

- Quasi-experimental approaches have been applied in other elimination campaigns.  

- Barofsky et al. used SCM as an approach for the identification of the impact of a malaria campaign in a district in Uganda.   
- These studies are from 50s-60s and look at economic indicators, such as primary school completion or households consumption.   
- To our knowledge, this is the first quasi-experimental evaluation of an ongoing elimination initiative using routine national surveillance data on health indicators.   

## Comparison with RCT

- Randomized control trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for impact evaluations.   
- However, the implementation of RCTs may imply financial, practical and ethical challenges.  
- Furthermore, RCTs have debatable usefulness in identifying intervention feasibility and implementation bottlenecks, which are particularly important in disease elimination contexts.
- Quasi-experimental approaches are particularly useful when applied to routinely collected (administrative/observational) data. 

## Scaling up the method?

- Given the focus over the last decade on malaria elimination with both large and small scale campaigns across the globe – quasi-experimental approaches offer a rigorous and inexpensive alternative to randomized-control trials. 

- Observational data is widely (and often publicly) available and true experimental approaches are often not feasible:  quasi-experimental approaches like the SCM are an excellent alternative for the evaluation of malaria elimination initiatives. 

- Approach is not only suitable for the estimation of the impact of the intervention in question, but also generalizable to malaria elimination campaigns globally.   

## Limitations 

1. We rely on surveillance malaria cases reported at the health facility level, which is an incomplete and imperfect proxy for true malaria infection incidence since health-seeking behavior is especially low in low-income countries settings and may be different across geography and time.

2. The health facility registries from which we gathered data are themselves imperfect; we have no mechanisms by which to validate the entirety of the data. Still, BES data offers the best country-wide comparison of malaria trends at a granular level (weekly and by district).

3. Even with quasi-experimental data, we still can't fully control for abnormalities... (see next slide)

           color = year)) +

## Implications  

- The strategy reduced malaria significantly.   
- Effectiveness quantified accurately enough to allow for granular cost-effectiveness.   
- Synthetic control method useful and generalizable for the estimation of similar initiatives’ effectiveness.   
- Policy-makers, researchers, and those actively engaged in or planning disease elimination initiatives, can benefit from both the methods and findings from this study.
